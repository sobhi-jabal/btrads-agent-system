# Test: LLM Extraction Now Works Correctly

## What Was Fixed

The BTRADSDecisionFlow component was running its own NLP pattern matching even when LLM extraction was selected and succeeded. This was happening because:

1. The code checked extraction results
2. If not missing, it should have used those results
3. Instead, it always ran its own pattern matching

## Changes Made

1. **Added proper handling of extraction results**: After checking if extraction is missing, we now properly use the LLM/NLP results
2. **Made pattern matching conditional**: The hardcoded NLP only runs if no extraction is available
3. **Unified the logic**: Both LLM and NLP results now flow through the same decision logic

## How to Test

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Extraction Settings" 
3. Select "LLM Analysis (Ollama phi4:14b)"
4. Enter a clinical note:
   ```
   Patient on dexamethasone 4mg daily, dose increased from 2mg last week.
   Started first Avastin infusion on 12/1/2024.
   ```
5. Click "Start BT-RADS Analysis"

## Expected Behavior

- The system should use Ollama to extract:
  - steroid_status: "increasing" 
  - avastin_status: "first_treatment"
- The decision flow should show:
  - "Both Avastin (status: first_treatment) and steroids (status: increasing) identified via LLM analysis"
  - It should proceed to the Avastin pathway
- The evidence display should show the enhanced evidence from LLM extraction

## What NOT to Expect

- The system should NOT show generic pattern matching results
- It should NOT override the LLM results with its own NLP
- The status values should match what the LLM extracted, not generic "stable" or "ongoing"

## Verification

You can verify by:
1. Looking at the reasoning text - it should mention "via LLM analysis" and show the specific statuses
2. The evidence should come from the LLM extraction with relevance scores and pattern types
3. The confidence should reflect the LLM confidence, not hardcoded values
