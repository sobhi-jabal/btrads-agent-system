APP: ELIZABETH GILLIOM EVANS, PA             Identifying Statement:    Lynda Chestnutt  is a 66 y.o. female from Clinton, NC  with right parietal Glioblastoma (WHO gr IV) with gliosarcoma components diagnosed 6/28/2016.    Treatment to be received:  Cycle 3, day 15 of Avastin 10mg/kg IV. Cycle 3 etoposide to be ordered today; this was delayed due to UTI.     Interval History:  Lynda Chestnutt returns to clinic for a treatment evaluation, accompanied by her husband Albert and daughter Justina. She remains on therapy with Avastin and Etoposide. Etoposide was held for about a week during cycle 2 secondary to her being febrile and having a UTI. This was restarted on 9/10/2018 and finished 9/15.     Today, Lynda Chestnutt is nonverbal, and history is provided by her family. They took her to their local ED on 9/18 for AMS. In retrospect, her family feels this was due to being overheated and dehydrated without electricity following Tropical Storm Florence. A CT brain was done and showed increased cerebral edema, per chart. Local provider spoke with Dr. Katy Peters, who recommended increased Decadron. She was sent home on 8mg three times daily, but Justina reports she has been giving her mother 8mg just twice daily with some improvement of symptoms. She is minimally interactive. She occasionally lets them know when she needs to use the bathroom. No recent seizures. She remains hemiparetic on the left and has intermittent incontinence.     She is coughing intermittently and does cough up some mucous in the mornings, per Albert. She does not show signs of dysphagia, per family. She is not coughing up bloody or discolored sputum. No fever, chills, 
shortness of breath. She continues on Lovenox for history of PE and prophylactic Macrobid for history of recurrent UTI.

Update after clinic: Daughter Justina returns to report her mother vomited liquid with possible small white fragments about 5 minutes after taking afternoon seizure meds. No capsules or tablets seen in the expelled stomach contents. Recommended that they not repeat dosing since whole capsules were not seen. Patient has had 8mg of Decadron already today so seizure would be unlikely.

CONTRAST: 15mL MultiHance IV. This MRI was performed before and after IV  administration of contrast material. IV contrast was administered to  improve disease detection and further define anatomy.   *    GFR:  >60 mL/min/1.73 square meters.  *    Complications:  No immediate patient complications or events noted.    FINDINGS:   Postoperative changes of right frontal craniotomy with subjacent resection  cavity redemonstrated. Surrounding T2/FLAIR signal abnormality is slightly  increased along the right corpus callosal splenium (series 4 image 25) and  right peritrigonal white matter. Progressive atrophy of the right cerebral  peduncle is identified. Subtle multinodular enhancement along the right  frontal horn is not significantly changed measuring up to 5 mm along the  anterior margin of the right frontal horn.    Other Brain Parenchyma:  No hemorrhage or acute cortical infarction.  No  midline shift.  
Ventricles: No hydrocephalus.  Ex vacuo dilatation of the right frontal  horn.   Extra-Axial Spaces: No extra-axial fluid collection.  Basal Cisterns: The basal cisterns are maintained.  Intracranial Flow-Voids: Normal.    Paranasal Sinuses: Normal.  Mastoid Sinuses: Normal.  Orbits: Normal.    IMPRESSION:   1. Nonenhancing, slightly mass-like FLAIR signal abnormality in the right  corpus callosal splenium and peritrigonal white matter is increased from  the prior study. This finding is non-specific.  2. Stippled enhancement along the right frontal horn is stable.      Electronically Reviewed by:  Dan Pong, MD, Duke Radiology  Electronically Reviewed on:  12/12/2018 10:30 AM    I have reviewed the images and concur with the above findings.    Electronically Signed by:  Christopher Lascola, MD, Duke Radiology  Electronically Signed on:  12/13/2018 1:57 PM       Duke BTC MRI Interpretation: MRI from 12/11/18 was compared to MRI from 10/03/18 by Dina M RANDAZZO, DO  using actual scan.  Findings included slight increase in FLAIR at the thalamus and corpus callosum.  T1+C reveals slight increase of enhancement at the corpus at the right. MRI was reviewed with patient by ELIZABETH GILLIOM EVANS, PA-C.     Assessment & Plan:     1. Right insular glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV, IDH-mutant) transformed from astrocytoma (WHO gr II)    Shelley Grant is neurologically stable. Her MRI again shows slightly increased enhancement which bears close monitoring but does not meet criteria for progressive disease. As liver enzymes are trending up and as she has abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, we will hold lomustine at this point and will most likely not resume this medication.     She will continue Avastin 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. We will defer today's planned treatment until after her upcoming abdominal ultrasound (12/14) in case surgical intervention is necessary.  Avastin infusion has been 
rescheduled for next Friday 12/21.  She will return again in 3 weeks for treatment.     We would like to see her back in Dr. Randazzo's clinic with a new MRI in 4 weeks.     2. Abnormal UA   Prescribed Macrobid and instructed Ms. Grant to take this prescription if she is symptomatic for UTI. She did not complain of dysuria, urgency, frequency during clinic. Sample resulted after her visit.     3. Daily headaches   Prescribed amitriptyline 12.5mg QHS x 8 days then increase to 25mg QHS.   Recommend she minimize Tylenol use.     The patient agrees with the plan and will contact us in the interim with any questions or concerns.    ELIZABETH GILLIOM EVANS, PA    Attending Attestation:     I personally had a face to face encounter and performed a substantive portion of this E/M encounter in conjunction with the listed APP/NPP and agree with the above.  I reviewed the MRI findings with them and explained the subtle changes.  Given her increased transaminases and her abdominal pain, I am more concerned that the lomustine is causing this.  We will old avastin this week in light od her abdominal ultrasound and will restart if next week if no surgical intervention is needed. For now, we will give avastin only given her fatigue and pain.  I answered all of their questions to their satisfaction.    Dina Randazzo DO              ",12/13/2018,1/22/2019,76.755,1.2,83.459,10.676,6.704,9,9.476,790,3,3c

PROCEDURE: MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST   Multiplanar multisequence imaging.  15 ml IV MultiHance.     COMPARISON:  11.01.2019 .     FINDINGS:    No midline shift. The ventricular system is open without hydrocephalus. The  cerebral sulci are not effaced. The patient is status post left  frontotemporal craniotomy. The extra-axial fluid collection underlying the  craniotomy site has reduced in size, currently measuring up to 4 mm in  width, as compared to approximately 8 mm previously.     Fluid within the left frontal lobe resection bed has decreased in size.  
Relatively thin circumferential enhancement within the resection bed is  present but has diminished since the prior study. There is residual  diffusion restriction in the margin of the resection bed though diminished  from previous.      There is no signal abnormality or volume loss identified within the left  caudate head.      There is however residual signal abnormality in the left aspect of the  splenium of corpus callosum. Currently there is a nonenhancing T2  hyperintensity measuring 6 mm within the left posterior paramedian aspect  of the splenium (6:15) that is stable in size from previous. There is  minimal increased T2 FLAIR signal within the immediately adjacent splenium,  though this has diminished from previous, and there is no associated  enhancement. No focus of diffusion restriction suggestive of acute  infarction is demonstrated.      There is susceptibility artifact along the margin of the resection cavity  consistent with postsurgical change. No new distant enhancing lesion is  identified. No definite ependymal enhancement abnormality.     Mild mucosal thickening identified in the paranasal sinuses but without  complete sinus opacification or air-fluid level. No mastoid effusion.  Calvarium demonstrates a grossly unremarkable marrow signal pattern.     IMPRESSION:  1.  The left frontal lobe resection cavity has decreased in size, with  persistent though diminished enhancement along the resection cavity margin.  2. No caudate head abnormality identified to correspond with previous  imaging findings.  3. Stable small cystic appearing structure at the posterior left paramedian  aspect of the splenium. However adjacent T2 signal has diminished though  not fully resolved.  4. Diminished extra-axial fluid collection subjacent to left frontal  temporal craniotomy     Electronically Signed by:  Samuel Bone III, MD, Durham Radiology  Electronically Signed on:  1/2/2020 2:46 PM     
BTC MRI Interpretation: MRI from 01/02/20 was compared to MRI from 11/01/20 by DANIEL BRYCE LANDI, MD using actual scan. Findings included decreased FLAIR, collapsed resection cavity and is consistent with recent radiation therapy.     Assessment & Plan:  1. Anaplastic astrocytoma of left frontal lobe (WHO Grade III)   James Whitaker is clinically stable and MRI shows expected radiation related changes. He will proceed with 5-day Temodar 200 mg/m2 po and return to clinic in 2 months with a new MRI. Temodar will be ordered by his local oncologist. Dr. Hanna. Temodar will be on hold if platelet is below 100,000 and/or ANC 1000, AGOT/AST >/= 2 xULN. He was advised to contact us with any questions or concerns during the interim.    The patient is in agreeance and understanding of this plan.   All questions were answered to their apparent satisfaction.    Jung-Young Kim, DNP, APRN, ANP    I personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this encounter in conjunction with the listed APP as documented above.  It was nice seeing Burke today.  He did well with radiation, and his MRI today looks good.  He will establish care with a local team in Knoxville as he returns to college, and we will see him in about 2 months for a new MRI.

ELIZABETH GILLIOM EVANS, PA         Attending Attestation:       I personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this encounter in conjunction with the listed APP as documented above. I also reviewed the MRI result with Pearl Carr-Notice and her husband. I reviewed with them the recommendation for continued serial MRI monitoring. I also discussed with her the importance of her using her CPAP at night, as untreated sleep apnea can be in part responsible for her cognitive worsening. I also reviewed with them the recommendation to increase Aricept to 10 mg daily. Finally, I encouraged Pearl to exercise at least 3 times a week. I answered all their questions to their apparent satisfaction. Support was given.

New enhancing nodule along the anterior superior aspect of the resection  cavity. Minimally increased surrounding FLAIR high signal.           BTC MRI Interpretation: MRI from 12/13/18 was compared to MRI from 10/18/18 by MARGARET OLGA JOHNSON, MD  using actual scan.  Findings included new area of enhancement anterior to the resection cavity, measuring approximately 9.5 mm and is consistent with stable disease.    Assessment & Plan:   1. Left parietal glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV)  Elizabeth Reece returns to clinic for routine follow up. She is clinically stable.  MRI shows a new subcentimeter nodular area of enhancement anterior to the resection cavity.  Given its small size we cannot definitively call this tumor progression at this time.  We would therefore recommend a close interval MRI and return clinic visit in 4 weeks.  We will proceed with cycle #7 of 5-day temozolomide, due to start 12/18/2018.    JUSTIN THOMAS LOW, MD  Neuro-oncology fellow  Pager 919-970-1649      Attending Attestation:     I confirm that I was present for the key and critical portions of the service, including a review of the patient's history and other pertinent data.  I personally examined the patient, and formulated the evaluation and/or treatment plan.  I have reviewed the note of the house staff and agree with the findings documented in the note, with any exceptions as noted below.    Neurological examination was within normal limits.     I explained the MRI findings at length with Elizabeth Reece. I explained the rationale for frequent monitoring with imaging and the patient will return for MRI and visit in one month. She will continue with temozolomide. If there is further growth of this area we will consider a treatment change in one month.      Margaret O.

An enhancing cystic mass is centered within the left temporal lobe  with nodular enhancement along the margins, most pronounced inferiorly.  When compared to 5/16/2018, there is increased in size and morphology  conglomerate and nodular enhancement peripherally, most conspicuously in  the inferomedial temporal lobe with extension into the left thalamus  (Series 9, image 83). Overall, the mass is slightly increased in size  measuring 5.8 x 4.9 cm, previously 5.7 x 4.8 cm. Similar surrounding  increased T2 weighted signal. Redemonstrated intrinsic T1 signal within  areas of nodular enhancement suggestive of a hemorrhagic component.     Other brain parenchyma: No acute infarction.

Findings consistent with tumor progression with more conglomerate and  increased in size nodular enhancement, most conspicuously in the  inferomedial temporal lobe with extension into the left thalamus.     Pending radiology attending read     BTC Imaging Assessment:   MRI from 07/11/18 was compared to MRI from 05/16/18 by Dina M RANDAZZO, DO  using actual scan.  Findings included slight increase of FLAIR and enhancement mostly near the midbrain and is consistent with stable disease.     Impression/Plan:   1. Glioblastoma of left temporal lobe  Billie Sweeney is clinically stable and aysmptomatic with a stable MRI of her brain. Therefore we recommend continuing CPT 11 (Irinotecan) 125mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks with Avastin 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks AND metronomic Temodar (50mg/m2) daily.      While on therapy we recommend continuing to evaluate a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel and a urinalysis performed every 14 days prior to receiving these therapies.      We recommend holding Temodar and CPT 11 if the ANC < 1,000, platelets < 100,000 and/or LFT's or creatinine > 2x ULN.  We recommend holding Avastin if the ANC <500, platelets are < 500,  LFT's or creatinine > 2x ULN and/or urine protein >/= to 4 as Avastin can cause nephrotic syndrome.    2.  Hypertension   Improved on Amlodipine. Continue.    3. Insomnia  Failed both Remeron and Zolpidem.  Recommend considering Zolpidem XR given she has failed both medications and if the insurance refuses this, then Roserem would be a reasonable option to try.    4. Nausea  Not tolerating zofran 2/2 constipation, wanted to discuss other medication options. Compazine prescription refilled and sent to their home pharmacy with patient/husband instructed to try this in the future.      Ms. Sweeney will return to Duke in 8 weeks with a new MRI at Duke for interval evaluation.  We encouraged her to contact us to be seen sooner 
should she develop any new symptoms.   We appreciate her local oncologist, Dr. Jaishankar, managing her local care. The patient  and her husband were given the opportunity to ask questions and to have those questions answered to their satisfaction.

Oncology Treatment History:     Left parietal glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV)    12/8/2014 Radiology Study     After approximately 1 to 1.5 years of headaches, radiographic work up revealed a left parietal mass.         12/10/2014 Surgery     Craniotomy for subtotal resection performed. Pathology: glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV). Local pathology: IDH1-R132H positive in scattered tumor cells, Ki-67 variably positive (5-25% among tumor cells), MGMT promoter partially methylated.         1/15/2015 - 2/27/2015 Radiation     Standard of care radiation therapy with concurrent Temodar daily.         3/30/2015 - 7/11/2016 Chemotherapy     5-day temozolomide x 17 cycles.  New patient consultation at Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke mid-cycle 2 (5/4/2015); recommended continuing 5-day temozolomide.         7/12/2016 Radiology Study     Persistent but stable enhancement on MRI.  PET scan of brain showed ""no foci of hypermetabolic FDG activity identified to suggest local residual or recurrent high grade tumor."" Clinical concern for disease remained, thus patient was referred to Dr. Allan Friedman for possible biopsy.         7/13/2016 Biopsy     Stereotactic biopsy of enhancing areas in left parietal lobe, at Duke by Dr. Allan Friedman. Pathology reported ""Brain tissue with therapy-related effects and focal mildly increased cellularity consistent with persistent glioma, low grade."" Dr. Henry Friedman recommends  continuing therapy with 
daily temozolomide 50 mg/m?.         7/29/2016 - 9/19/2017 Chemotherapy     Metronomic temozolomide, 50 mg/m? daily ?13 cycles.         7/11/2017 Radiology Study     MRI with new 4mm nodule w/associated surrounding T2/FLAIR signal abnormality.         9/19/2017 Radiology Study     Stable MRI. PET cold including the 4 mm subependymal nodule identified on MRI,  though this is likely below PET resolution. Patient referred again to Dr. Allan Friedman for possible resection.         10/11/2017 Surgery     Resection with Dr. Allan Friedman; pathology reveals ""Brain tissue with therapy-related effect and persistent/recurrent infiltrating astrocytoma. The Ki-67 index is low, approximately 1%.""  Drs. Henry Friedman and Allan Friedman recommend no further chemotherapy at this time, and serial MRI monitoring q 2 months.

Right Parietal glioblastoma s/p Polio 12/2015    Carol Meiners returns to clinic and is clinically and radiographically stable.  MRI shows stable FLAIR without any enhancement. . Avastin was started on 4/5/18 as q3 week dosing and will be continued until she returns in April following vacation. MRI in 4 months when she returns from Arizona.   2. Deconditioning  Pain in L shoulder and worsening neglect of L side has led to steady worsening of her ability to ambulate from walking fully in April to a rigid walker in June to now being nearly wheelchair bound requiring at least 1 person support w PT. Continue with PT . Will request nutrition consultation at DUH which she may be able to schedule with her upcoming appointments. Encouraged use of memory programs including Luminosity to maintain activity.  She is currently on Gabapentin, Tramadol, and tylenol. Advised to limit tramadol and tylenol to only when needed and use gabapentin 300 mg bid.    She will benefit from ongoing PT/OT and should consider massage and acupuncture therapy. External referrals provided to PT/OT for Iowa and internal referral for nutrition. An external ref for nutrition was provided should she not be able to meet with a nutritionist to discuss her weight management plan to fit with days she is coming to the cancer center.   3. Left leg pain  Continue with physical therapy and aquatics, work on standing and walking. Ultrasound left leg today to r/o DVT.   The patient is in agreeance with the plan and will contact us in the interim with any questions or concerns.  NALI J GILLESPIE, Med Student       
I was present with the medical student and patient during the History and Physical Exam. I verify the findings documented, personally re-performed a Physical Exam, and agree with the Medical Decision Making (Assessment and Plan), with changes to the note by me (ATTSTTP). I discussed her functional decline is most likely multifactorial due to necrosis of her brain, deconditioning, pain and a possible stroke which could have started her decline. Since her MRI has been stable, deconditioning is most likely the cause of her decline now and she was encouraged to continue with PT/OT.  We will continue with Avastin for now and then can discontinue it when she returns if stable.  We can also increase the time between MRIs at that point also.  I answered all of their questions to their satisfaction.     Dina M RANDAZZO, DO              ",8/16/2018,4/25/2019,130.761,4.05,109.943,0.423,-20.818,-16,-3.627,-100,2,2

May I speak to Kelly Dupree?      If eligible subject is speaking or available, then proceed.  If potentially eligible subject is not available, then leave message for eligible subject to call back.    I am calling from The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke.  Thank you for scheduling a clinic visit with us to further discuss your participation in our study at Duke.   Do you have time to speak with me now regarding your visit on Oct 17, 2018?  Our phone conversation should take about 10 minutes.    As you may remember, the title of this study is ?A Phase 1, Multicenter, Open-label, Dose-escalation, Combination Study of Marizomib and Bevacizumab in Bevacizumab-Naive Subjects with WHO Grade IV Malignant Glioma Followed by a Phase 2 Trial of Single Agent Marizomib and a Phase 1 Dose-escalation Study of Enternally-Administerd Marizomib with Bevacizumib? and the study doctor is Dr. Annick Desjardins.  Some of the activities that may be included for some people in this study are; ECGs, blood tests, and requesting a sample of your stored tumor tissue. When you come in, we will discuss the research study in detail, and you can decide at that time whether or not you wish to sign the consent form and participate in the study.      However, the purpose of my phone call today is to ask your permission to schedule certain research activities in Duke?s electronic scheduling 
system prior to your visit.  Specifically, I?m asking your permission to useyour health information to schedule some of the activities I just mentioned.  That way, if you decide to participate and sign the consent form, this pre-scheduling will save you an additional trip to Duke later.      If you agree to the use of your health information for scheduling, it in no way obligates you to sign the written consent form when you come in for your clinic visit.  If you decide not to participate in the study, the pre-scheduling order will simply be cancelled at no cost to you. You can also refuse to grant permission for the pre-scheduling and still sign the consent form and participate in the study.  It may simply mean an additional trip to Duke for you.      If you agree to grant your permission to use your health information in this way, it means that your information will be linked to this study and may be seen by members of the study team and the Duke personnel who are associated with scheduling.  The only risk to you in agreeing to this use of your information is the risk of loss of confidentiality.  However, all of the individuals who will see your information and its link to this study are trained professionals who work with healthcare information daily and are aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of health records.    Your health information will be used solely to pre-schedule these study activities prior to the formal written consent process.    May I have your permission to use your health information to pre-schedule these research activities, with the understanding that this in no way obligates you to participate in the study?    Yes, 11/14/18 8:45am.  Thank you.  I will  proceed with the pre-scheduling.  I look forward to meeting you at your clinic visit and discussing the details of the study with you at that time.

ADDITIONAL CLINICAL HISTORY: Recurrent    BASELINE COMPARISON: None  ADDITIONAL COMPARISON(S): MRI brain 7/24/2018    TECHNIQUE/PROTOCOL: Brain tumor protocol.    CONTRAST: 15mL MultiHance IV. This MRI was performed before and after IV  administration of contrast material. IV contrast was administered to  
improve disease detection and further define anatomy.   *    GFR: GFR lab draw before contrast administration was not performed due  to the patient's age and normal renal history.  *    Complications:  No immediate patient complications or events noted.    FINDINGS:   Postoperative changes of right frontal craniotomy with subjacent resection  cavity redemonstrated. Irregular enhancing nodule at the superior aspect of  the resection cavity has increased in size and now measures 16 x 19 x 13  mm. There is a new enhancing lesion in the left cingulate gyrus (series 9,  image 132) measuring approximately 12 x 5 x 7 mm. Mild interval increase in  the T2 hyperintensity in the left cingulate gyrus. Maintaining distribution  of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the left frontal parietal and left corona  radiata are unchanged.    Other Brain Parenchyma:  No hemorrhage or acute cortical infarction.  No  midline shift.  Ventricles: No hydrocephalus.   Extra-Axial Spaces: No extra-axial fluid collection.  Basal Cisterns: The basal cisterns are maintained.  Intracranial Flow-Voids: Normal.    Paranasal Sinuses: Opacification of the right maxillary sinus and mild  mucosal thickening of the ethmoid and frontal sinuses is noted.  Mastoid Sinuses: Normal.  Orbits: Normal.        IMPRESSION:   Interval worsening with increase in irregular nodular enhancement in the  right frontal lobe with new enhancing lesion in the left cingulate gyrus.  Mild interval increase in the T2 hyperintensity.

 using actual scan.  Findings included stable FLAIR and enhancement with slight changes which is most likely avastin withdrawal but new area of enhancement in the posterior parasagittal region and is consistent with stable disease but concern for progression.    Assessment & Plan:   1. right frontal Glioblastoma    James Timothy Sullivan is clinically stable however MRI shows increased enhancement in the R frontal lobe and L cingulate gyrus.  These changes occurred in conjunction with a delay in Avastin.  These changes may be relayed to delay in therapy vs tumor progression.  At this time we recommend:   Continuation of Avastin 7.5mg/kg IV q 4 weeks   MRI and return in 1 month.  2. Fatigue:    Requested Prescriptions     Signed Prescriptions Disp Refills   ? methylphenidate HCl (RITALIN) 10 MG tablet 60 tablet 0     Sig: Take 1 tablet (10 mg total) by mouth 2 (two) times daily.     I have personally reviewed James Timothy Sullivan's record in the North Carolina Controlled Substances Reporting System for a period of 12 months prior to prescribing the controlled substance(s) noted.   Patient was not found.    I have had a meaningful discussion with attending physician Dr. Randazzo regarding the necessity of long term use of controlled substances for James Timothy Sullivan.     The patient is in agreeance with the plan and will contact us in the interim with any questions or concerns.  CINDY C SOUTHERLAND, NP      Attending Attestation:     I personally had a face to face encounter and performed a substantive portion of this E/M encounter in conjunction with the listed APP/NPP and agree with the above.  I discussed the plan, reviewed the MRI findings with them and answered all of their questions to their satisfaction. We also discussed possible future treatment options such as re infusion of PVSRIPO and RT if the MRI worsens.
