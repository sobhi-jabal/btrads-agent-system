# Fix Summary: LLM Extraction Without Validation UI

## Problem
When using LLM extraction mode, the system was showing the manual validation UI even when extraction succeeded. This happened because:
1. The system marked extraction as "missing" when values were "unknown"
2. The system also used a confidence < 50% check as a fallback

## Solution

### 1. ExtractionFunctions.tsx
- Changed `isMissing` to always be `false` when LLM extraction succeeds
- Only set `isMissing = true` when extraction actually fails (network error, timeout, etc.)
- Removed the logic that marked extraction as missing when values were "unknown"

### 2. BTRADSDecisionFlow.tsx  
- Removed confidence < 50 fallback checks for both medications and radiation date
- Now only checks the explicit `isMissing` flag from extraction
- This ensures validation UI only shows when extraction truly fails

## Result
- When LLM extraction returns "unknown" values → No validation UI
- When LLM extraction fails with error → Shows validation UI
- System proceeds with extracted values even if they're "unknown"

## Testing
1. API test confirms LLM extraction works:
   - With medications: Returns specific status (e.g., "stable", "none")
   - Without medications: Returns "unknown" for both
   - Processing time: ~7-27 seconds depending on complexity

2. Frontend should now:
   - Use LLM results directly without showing validation
   - Only show validation if Ollama is down or times out

The system now works as requested: no fallbacks, LLM extraction results are used as-is.
