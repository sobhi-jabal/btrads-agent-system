PT101,"MRI Brain with and without contrast: History: 65-year-old male with glioblastoma, status post resection and chemoradiation. Findings: Post-surgical cavity in the right temporal lobe. Enhancing nodular tissue along the medial margin measuring 15 x 12 mm, increased from 10 x 8 mm. Surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity has increased. No new lesions identified. Impression: Findings concerning for tumor progression."
PT102,"MRI Brain follow-up: Clinical history: 58-year-old female with anaplastic astrocytoma, 6 months post radiation therapy. Technique: Multiplanar multisequence MRI. Findings: Left frontal lobe resection cavity stable. Previously noted enhancement has decreased in size. Minimal surrounding edema. No new enhancing lesions. Impression: Improvement in enhancement, likely treatment response."
PT103,"Brain MRI with contrast: Indication: Follow-up oligodendroglioma. Prior radiation 2 months ago. Findings: Right parietal tumor site shows increased FLAIR signal and new patchy enhancement measuring 2.5 cm. Mass effect on adjacent sulci. Comparison shows progression from prior study. Patient recently started on Avastin. Impression: Progressive disease versus pseudoprogression."
