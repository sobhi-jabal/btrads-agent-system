# Test LLM Extraction Without Validation UI

## What Changed

1. **ExtractionFunctions.tsx**:
   - `isMissing` is now `false` when LLM extraction succeeds (even if values are "unknown")
   - `isMissing` is only `true` when LLM extraction actually fails with an error

2. **BTRADSDecisionFlow.tsx**:
   - Removed confidence < 50 fallback check for medications
   - Removed confidence < 50 fallback check for radiation date
   - Now only checks the explicit `isMissing` flag

## Testing Steps

1. Ensure all services are running:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend: http://localhost:8001
   - Ollama: http://localhost:11434

2. Go to http://localhost:3001

3. Click "Extraction Settings" and select "LLM Analysis (Ollama phi4:14b)"

4. Enter a clinical note in the Clinical Note Analysis section

5. Click "Start BT-RADS Analysis"

## Expected Behavior

- The system should use Ollama to extract medication and radiation information
- Even if the extracted values are "unknown", it should NOT show the validation UI
- The validation UI should only appear if Ollama actually fails/times out
- Processing should continue through the BT-RADS flowchart with the extracted values

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Note with clear medication info
```
Patient on dexamethasone 4mg daily. Started Avastin last week.
Completed radiation therapy on 10/15/2024.
```
Expected: Extracts medications and radiation date, no validation UI

### Case 2: Note with no medication info
```
Follow-up MRI shows increased enhancement. 
No mention of medications in this visit.
```
Expected: Extracts "unknown" for medications, but NO validation UI

### Case 3: Network/Ollama failure
```
(Disconnect Ollama or cause timeout)
```
Expected: Shows validation UI because extraction actually failed
