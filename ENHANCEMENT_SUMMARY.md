# BT-RADS Extraction Enhancement Summary

## Overview
We've significantly improved the LLM extraction to follow the comprehensive structure from `btrads_main_old.py`, providing more specific and detailed extraction results with enhanced evidence highlighting.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Backend Prompts
- **Updated prompts** to match the exact BT-RADS flowchart prompts from the original pipeline
- **Added 6 new extraction types** beyond just medications and radiation:
  - `suitable_prior`: Check for prior imaging availability
  - `imaging_assessment`: Compare current vs prior imaging with volume rules
  - `on_medications`: Determine medication effects on improvement
  - `avastin_response`: Analyze Avastin response type
  - `steroid_effects`: Analyze steroid effect timing
  - `time_since_xrt`: Apply 90-day radiation rule

### 2. Enhanced Evidence Extraction
- **Sentence-level context**: Evidence now includes full sentences (150 chars before/after) instead of just 50 characters
- **Pattern typing**: Each evidence item has a specific pattern type (e.g., "specific_dose", "first_treatment", "date_range")
- **Relevance scoring**: Evidence is scored based on pattern importance (0.5-0.95)
- **Confidence calculation**: Dynamic confidence based on pattern type and extraction results
- **More evidence**: Returns up to 10 evidence items instead of 3-5

### 3. Improved Pattern Matching
#### Medications:
- Added specific patterns for dose mentions, increases, decreases
- Better detection of first Avastin treatment vs ongoing
- Cycle number detection for Avastin

#### Radiation:
- Enhanced date range detection (from X to Y)
- Better "last dose" pattern matching
- Completion date prioritization

### 4. Frontend Enhancements
- **EvidenceHighlighter** now shows:
  - Relevance scores
  - Pattern types
  - Full context snippets
  - Better organization by relevance
- **EnhancedEvidenceDisplay** component for detailed evidence viewing
- **transformEvidence** function to convert backend evidence to frontend format

## Example Results

### Before:
```json
{
  "evidence": [{
    "type": "steroid",
    "text": "amethasone 4mg daily. Dose was increased from 2mg",
    "confidence": 0.8
  }]
}
```

### After:
```json
{
  "evidence": [{
    "type": "steroid",
    "category": "medication",
    "text": "Patient on dexamethasone 4mg daily. Dose was increased from 2mg last week due to worsening symptoms.",
    "matched_text": "dexamethasone 4mg",
    "pattern_type": "specific_dose",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "relevance_score": 0.9,
    "context_start": 0,
    "context_end": 99
  }]
}
```

## Next Steps

While we've completed the extraction enhancement, these items remain for full parity with `btrads_main_old.py`:

1. **Smart Medical Chunking**: Implement medical-aware text chunking that preserves context
2. **RAG Support**: Add retrieval-augmented generation for better context selection
3. **Volume Data Integration**: Pass volume data to imaging assessment nodes
4. **Full Flowchart Implementation**: Complete all BT-RADS nodes (what_is_worse, how_much_worse, etc.)

## Testing

The enhanced extraction can be tested with:
```bash
# Medications with detailed evidence
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/llm/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clinical_note": "Patient on dexamethasone 4mg daily. Started Avastin infusion #1.",
    "extraction_type": "medications"
  }'

# Radiation with date ranges
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/llm/extract \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clinical_note": "Completed radiation from 9/1/2024 to 10/15/2024.",
    "extraction_type": "radiation_date"
  }'
```

The system now provides much more specific extraction results with detailed evidence that helps users understand exactly what was found and why.
