# Test: Full BT-RADS Implementation with Complete Clinical Note View

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Transparency Levels
- Eliminated the 4-level transparency system (simple/detailed/expert/audit)
- All information is now shown by default
- No hidden details - everything is visible for physician verification

### 2. Added Full Clinical Note Panel
- New panel shows the complete clinical note with ALL evidence highlighted
- Evidence from all workflow steps is aggregated and displayed together
- Color-coded highlighting by category (medications, radiation, temporal, etc.)
- Summary section groups evidence by category

### 3. Evidence Aggregation
- Evidence is collected from each step as the workflow progresses
- Duplicate evidence is automatically filtered out
- Each piece of evidence maintains its source step for traceability

### 4. Enhanced Display
- All step cards now show complete information:
  - Evidence highlighting
  - Calculation breakdowns with formulas
  - Confidence indicators with full details
  - Decision audit trails with alternative paths
  - Verification panels for manual review

## How to Test

### 1. Start the System
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001

### 3. Test Case: Comprehensive Clinical Note

Enter this clinical note to test all features:

```
Patient continues on dexamethasone 4mg daily for vasogenic edema, dose stable for 3 months.
Started first Avastin (bevacizumab) infusion on 12/1/2024, well tolerated.
Completed radiation therapy (60 Gy) on 10/15/2024.

Current MRI (1/15/2025) compared to baseline (11/1/2024):
- FLAIR hyperintensity: decreased by 30%
- Enhancing component: decreased by 25%
- No new lesions identified
- Mild perilesional edema persists

Clinical status: Stable, no new neurological symptoms.
KPS 80, ambulatory with minimal assistance.
```

### 4. Configure Extraction
- Click "Extraction Settings"
- Select "LLM Analysis (Ollama phi4:14b)"
- Click "Start BT-RADS Analysis"

## Expected Results

### Full Clinical Note Panel (New!)
You should see a panel titled "Complete Clinical Note with All Evidence" that displays:

1. **The Full Text** with highlighted sections:
   - "dexamethasone 4mg daily" - highlighted in blue (medication)
   - "Avastin (bevacizumab) infusion on 12/1/2024" - highlighted in blue (medication)
   - "radiation therapy (60 Gy) on 10/15/2024" - highlighted in purple (radiation)
   - "decreased by 30%" - highlighted in green (imaging)
   - "decreased by 25%" - highlighted in green (imaging)

2. **Evidence Summary by Category**:
   - **Medication** (2 items):
     1. Patient continues on dexamethasone 4mg daily for vasogenic edema
     2. Started first Avastin (bevacizumab) infusion on 12/1/2024
   - **Radiation** (1 item):
     1. Completed radiation therapy (60 Gy) on 10/15/2024
   - **Imaging** (2 items):
     1. FLAIR hyperintensity: decreased by 30%
     2. Enhancing component: decreased by 25%

### Workflow Steps
Each step card should show ALL information without needing to click or expand:

1. **Node 1 - Suitable Prior Assessment**
   - Shows comparison dates
   - Full reasoning displayed
   - Confidence visualization

2. **Node 2 - Imaging Assessment**
   - Evidence highlighter showing volume changes
   - Calculation breakdown with formulas
   - Decision trail showing why "Improved" was selected

3. **Node 3A - Medication Check**
   - Evidence for both medications highlighted
   - Full decision logic visible
   - Alternative paths shown

4. **Node 3B - Avastin Response**
   - Evidence for first treatment
   - Confidence indicators
   - Verification items displayed

5. **Final BT-RADS Score**
   - Clear outcome with full justification
   - All supporting evidence listed
   - Complete decision path shown

## Verification Checklist

✓ **No Transparency Selector** - The detail level dropdown should be gone
✓ **Full Clinical Note View** - Complete note with all evidence highlighted in one place
✓ **Aggregated Evidence** - Evidence from all steps combined without duplicates
✓ **Complete Step Information** - All details visible without clicking "show more"
✓ **Proper Highlighting** - LLM-extracted sentences properly positioned and highlighted
✓ **Consistent Results** - All data flows correctly through the workflow
✓ **Physician-Friendly** - Clear reasoning at every step for manual verification

## Benefits for Physicians

1. **Single Source of Truth**: See the entire clinical note with all AI extractions at once
2. **Full Transparency**: Every decision, calculation, and alternative path is visible
3. **Easy Verification**: Color-coded evidence makes it simple to verify AI findings
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: Track exactly how the BT-RADS score was determined
5. **No Hidden Information**: Everything the AI considered is displayed upfront

## Troubleshooting

If evidence isn't highlighting properly:
1. Check that Ollama is running and phi4 model is loaded
2. Verify LLM extraction completed successfully
3. Look for any console errors in the browser
4. Ensure the clinical note contains the expected keywords

If the full clinical note panel doesn't appear:
1. Verify patient data was loaded correctly
2. Check that at least one workflow step has completed
3. Ensure evidence aggregation is working (check console logs)

## Architecture Summary

The system now provides:
- **Unified View**: All evidence in one clinical note panel
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Evidence aggregates as workflow progresses
- **No Information Hiding**: All analysis details visible by default
- **Physician-Centric Design**: Built for clinical verification and understanding
